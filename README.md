# Healthcare Data Platform Security Architecture System Design Proposal

## Scenario Overview
A healthcare technology company wants to build a secure data analytics platform that enables their data science teams to access sensitive patient data for analysis. They need to implement proper access controls and security frameworks but struggle with designing IAM architecture, ensuring compliance with healthcare regulations, and creating automated monitoring for access patterns and compliance violations. They have GCP experience and use Terraform for infrastructure but are unsure how to architect the security layer with proper observability for their data platform. This proposal outlines a systems approach for security architecture design, compliance implementation, and monitoring infrastructure - including recommendations for scalability and regulatory adherence.

## Proposal Framework
This Jupyter notebook presents a systems analysis and design approach to the healthcare data platform security challenge. The proposal follows established information systems design principles, emphasizing:
- **Security-First Design**: Methodical approach to implementing defense-in-depth security architecture with proper access controls
- **Compliance Integration**: Structured approach to embedding HIPAA and healthcare regulatory requirements into system design
- **Automated Governance**: Process-oriented approach to continuous monitoring, auditing, and compliance validation
- **Observable Security**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting framework for access patterns and security events

## System Components
The proposed solution addresses the following key subsystems:
1. **Identity and Access Management (IAM) Subsystem**
   - Role-based access control architecture
   - Authentication and authorization mechanisms
   - Privilege management and least-privilege enforcement
2. **Data Security Framework**
   - Encryption at rest and in transit implementation
   - Data classification and labeling systems
   - Secure data storage and access protocols
3. **Compliance and Governance Infrastructure**
   - HIPAA compliance monitoring systems
   - Audit trail generation and management
   - Regulatory reporting and documentation frameworks
4. **Monitoring and Observability Architecture**
   - Security event detection and analysis
   - Access pattern monitoring and anomaly detection
   - Automated alerting and incident response systems
5. **Infrastructure Security Framework**
   - Network security and segmentation design
   - Terraform-managed security policy implementation
   - GCP security service integration and configuration

## Implementation Considerations
The proposal includes high-level specifications for:
- Recommended technology stack
- System integration points
- Resource requirements
- Core security architecture components
