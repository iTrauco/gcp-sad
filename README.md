This notebook serves as a comprehensive system design proposal, providing the healthcare imaging company with a structured approach to implementing automated medical image processing pipeline architecture for their containerized workload orchestration and metadata analysis requirements.

## Scenario Overview
A healthcare imaging company wants to process and analyze medical images stored in Cloud Storage through automated pipelines using containerized workloads. They need guidance on Kubernetes orchestration, event-driven processing with Cloud Functions, and BigQuery metadata management for their systematic GCP-based approach. This proposal outlines a systems approach for container orchestration, automated processing pipelines, and metadata architecture - including recommendations for scalability and processing reliability.

## Proposal Framework
This Jupyter notebook presents a systems analysis and design approach to the medical imaging processing pipeline challenge. The proposal follows established information systems design principles, emphasizing:
- **Container-First Architecture**: Methodical approach to designing scalable containerized processing workflows with Kubernetes orchestration
- **Event-Driven Processing**: Structured approach to automated pipeline triggers and serverless processing with Cloud Functions
- **Metadata-Centric Design**: Process-oriented approach to comprehensive metadata capture and BigQuery analytics integration
- **Automated Pipeline Reliability**: Comprehensive monitoring, error handling, and workflow optimization for production processing

## System Components
The proposed solution addresses the following key subsystems:
1. **Container Orchestration Architecture**
   - Kubernetes Engine cluster management and scaling
   - Docker container deployment and lifecycle management
2. **Event-Driven Processing Framework**
   - Cloud Storage trigger mechanisms and Cloud Functions integration
   - Automated workflow orchestration and job scheduling
3. **Image Processing Pipeline Infrastructure**
   - Medical image analysis and transformation workflows
   - Containerized processing job management and queuing
4. **Metadata and Analytics Architecture**
   - BigQuery data warehouse for processing metadata and results
   - Data lineage tracking and processing audit trails
5. **Monitoring and Operations Framework**
   - Pipeline performance monitoring and container health checks
   - Resource optimization and error handling systems
