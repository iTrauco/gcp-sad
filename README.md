This notebook serves as a comprehensive system design proposal, providing the healthcare imaging company with a structured approach to implementing automated medical image processing pipeline architecture for their containerized workload orchestration and metadata analysis requirements.

## Scenario Overview
A healthcare imaging company wants to process and analyze medical images stored in Cloud Storage through automated pipelines using containerized workloads. They need guidance on Kubernetes orchestration, event-driven processing with Cloud Functions, and BigQuery metadata management for their systematic GCP-based approach. This proposal outlines a systems approach for container orchestration, automated processing pipelines, and metadata architecture - including recommendations for scalability and processing reliability.
